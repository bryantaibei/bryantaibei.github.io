## Brief Description

This is my Photoshop assignment of surreal. With the long time thinking and brainstorming, I want to create a picture that can represent my emotion in these days. In my mind, the basic tune of this picture is sorrow and nervous. And also express a feeling of being in the pressure. When you first look at this picture at first, you can feel the mood like depressing. The sky is grey and the clouds are black. When you take a good look at it, you can see it’s raining. A man in the suit and tie without head is standing there. The empty circle is in the position, which the heart should be. Flame like the eyes represent his desire of everything. He wants to control everything but he can’t. There are two more pairs of arms behind the back of this man. There are so many things he want to do and too many problems he want to solve at once. Candle is lighting but the fire is weak suggest this man is tired both in mental and physical. The indistinct skull appears inside the moon imply the man is exhausted and nearly dead. He felt tired about life and go out to meet people, just want to hide him and his from everyone else he known so he hide his face and just leave his hat in the air for polite purpose.
