## The Problem

The digital game should be entertainment that everyone can enjoy, but it’s challenging for some users to experience it. I have looked through several leading game platforms(Steam, Origin, Xbox Store, PS Store, Nintendo eShop) and didn’t see many games that are friendly to users with visual impairment. As a game designer, I want to bring them the fun of the games.

## The Solution

What is the initial impression of digital games when we talk about it? A realistic battlefield or an exciting magic world may appear in your mind. But what if we are not able to see any of them? Maybe we could use sounds!

The objective of my project designing and developing a digital game that is friendly to the visually impaired gamer. It is an endless runner game just like the subway surfer but has the unique mechanics that using stereo sound to dodge the obstacles, collect supplies, and survive as long as possible.

## The Build

### Unity Engine

During the semester, I’ve done many works on learning unity engine and C# scripting language. I don’t have the game coding experiences before, so it’s a big challenge for me. I have spent more than 200 hours learning Unity and coding. And turned everything that I have learned into my actual game.

### Audio Design

Making music is always one of my favorite things. For this project, I have made two soundtracks for a different purpose. One is the background music with surrounding sound effects when you play my game. The other one is the theme music for the ending scene that I have used the same chord as the in-game background music and extend it into a complete EDM genre song.

## The Process

### Phase 1 Learning

I have spent a long time learning everything to make a game. It means everything is new to me. I believe that it’s a great opportunity for me to get knowledge.

### Phase 2 Applying

Then I applied the new things that I have learned into my game to make it looks like a game, works like a game, and plays like a game.

### Phase 3 Creating

And finally, I combined the knowledge that I already have on music and the new things together to complete my goal and create a digital game for visually impaired players. I love all of them. Every process for me is a good thing. And lead me to success.

## Game Mechanic

Players are expected to complete the level without seeing the game screen. Players need to use the left arrow and right arrow on the keyboard to control the character, which is running straight forward on a 3 column track. There will be coins and capsules to collect as well as obstacles to dodge. With the help of headphones, you can hear the sound coming from different directions. It’s a hint. When you hear it from left, you need to press the left arrow to dodge the obstacles. And when it’s from right, you need to press the right arrow. As you run along the track, dodging and collecting. There will be a finish line in the front. Pass it, and then you will be lead to a result page. You can check your time and the items that you collect and enjoy the ending music.
