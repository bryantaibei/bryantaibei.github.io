# The Problem

Digital game should be an entertainment that everyone can enjoy, but it’s extremely difficult for some users to experience it. I have looked through several main game platforms(Steam, Origin, Xbox Store, PS Store, Nintendo eShop) and didn’t see many games which are friendly to the users with visual impairment. As a game designer, I want to bring them fun of the games.

# The Solution

The objective of my project it designing and developing a digital game that is friendly to the visually impaired gamer. 👉A endless runner game just like the subway surfer but have the unique mechanics that using stereo sound to dodge the obstacles, collect supplies and survive as long as possible.

## The Build

### Unity Engine

During the semester, I’ve done a lot of works on learning unity engine and C# scripting language. I don’t have the game coding experiences before so it’s a big challenge for me. I have spent more than 200 hours on learning the Unity and coding. And turned everything that I have learnt into my actual game.

### Audio Design

Making music is always one of my favorite things. For this project, I have made two sound tracks for the different purpose. One is the background music with surrounding sound effects when you play my game. The other one is the theme music for the ending scene that I have used the same chord as the in game background music and extend it into a complete EDM genre song.

### Refine

Making game is hard. It’s a quote of the creator of Super Mario Bros. Miyamoto. The legendary game designer in industry. I’ve faced a lot of challenges while making my game. I’m so glad that I have a nice mentor Matthew Board to help me dealing with so many weird problems that happen everywhere in the engine. And finally I successfully overcome all of it.

## The Process

### Learning

I have spent a long time on learning everything to make a game. It mean everything is new to me. I believe that it’s a great opportunity for me to get knowledge.

### Applying

Then I applied the new things that I have learnt into my game to make it looks like a game , works like a game and plays like a game.

### Creating

And finally, I combined the knowledges that I already have on music and the new things together to complete my goal and create a digital game for visually impaired players. I love the all of them. Every process to me is a good thing. And lead me to the success.
