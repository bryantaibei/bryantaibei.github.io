## Who Is Me?

Welcome and nice to meet you here! My name is Bryan Tai. And my Chinese name is 台北 (pronounced like 'Tie Bay'). I was born and grown up in Beijing, China and lived in here for 18 years. After graduating from high school in 2015, I came to the other side of the planet alone to get an undergradate education. The wonderful place that I lived and enjoyed for 4 years is called Miami University which located in Oxford, Ohio, United States of America. I learnt a lot throughout 4 years and find my passion on designing user experience and digital games. Now I'm graduated from college and started my journey to become a unique and passionate designer.

## Fun Facts

I'm more than a fan of music. It's part of my life. Guitar and Piano are my best friends. Even though I'm not a pro，creating and listening to music is still one of my favourite things to relax. Gun's N Roses and Green Day are my favorite bands. Let's rock!

Sometimes I love to record the moments:
