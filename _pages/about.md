## Who Is Me?

Well, My name is Bryan Tai. And my Chinese name is 台北 ( pronounced like 'Tie Bay' ). I was born and grown up in Beijing, China and lived in here for 18 years. After graduating from high school in 2015, I came to the other side of the planet alone to get an undergradate education. The wonderful place that I lived and enjoyed for 4 years is called Miami University which located in Oxford, Ohio, United States of America. I learnt a lot throughout 4 years and find my passion on designing user experience and digital games. Now I'm graduated from college and started my journey to become a unique and  designer.
