## Course Intro

This course focuses on developing an understanding of digital three-dimensional design and animation. Specifically, this course will focus on developing a foundation in the areas of 3D modeling, surfacing, and animation. During this course students will be introduced to the powerful and popular 3D animation program Maya, and guided through learning some of the tools and techniques used in 3D modeling and animation. While the emphasis will be on modeling, lighting, texturing and animation using Maya, work created during this course will serve as a tool for comprehending the underlying process of 3D design and animation.

## Texture Project

This is a assignment for learning how to apply the texture to the objects. I created textures for the objects in the room.

## Light Project

This is a assignment for learning how to give a static scene proper light. In this project, I created daylight effect and nightlight effect on a piano room scene.

## Midterm Project

In this project, we are expected to create a object that have texture and details. And we also need to use reference planes. I created a 3D model of iMac with the keyboard set.

## 3d Animation Project

In this project, I created a steel textured ball and a wood textured board with dominos on it. In the animation clip, the ball will drop from the air and triggered the dominos to fall down one by one. It's a combination of what I have leanrt through the semester and discovered the physics system in Maya.
