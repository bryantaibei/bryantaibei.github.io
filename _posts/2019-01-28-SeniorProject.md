## The Problem

Digital game should be an entertainment that everyone can enjoy, but it‚Äôs extremely difficult for some users to experience it. I have looked through several main game platforms(Steam, Origin, Xbox Store, PS Store, Nintendo eShop) and didn‚Äôt see many games which are friendly to the users with visual impairment. As a game designer, I want to bring them fun of the games.

## The Solution

What is the inital impression of the digital games when we talk about it. A realstic battlefield or a dramatic magicworld may appear in your mind. But what if we are not able to see any of them? Maybe we could use sounds!

The objective of my project it designing and developing a digital game that is friendly to the visually impaired gamer. üëâA endless runner game just like the subway surfer but have the unique mechanics that using stereo sound to dodge the obstacles, collect supplies and survive as long as possible.

### The Build

#### Unity Engine

During the semester, I‚Äôve done a lot of works on learning unity engine and C# scripting language. I don‚Äôt have the game coding experiences before so it‚Äôs a big challenge for me. I have spent more than 200 hours on learning the Unity and coding. And turned everything that I have learnt into my actual game.

#### Audio Design

Making music is always one of my favorite things. For this project, I have made two sound tracks for the different purpose. One is the background music with surrounding sound effects when you play my game. The other one is the theme music for the ending scene that I have used the same chord as the in game background music and extend it into a complete EDM genre song.

### The Process

#### Phase 1 Learning

I have spent a long time on learning everything to make a game. It mean everything is new to me. I believe that it‚Äôs a great opportunity for me to get knowledge.

#### Phase 2 Applying

Then I applied the new things that I have learnt into my game to make it looks like a game , works like a game and plays like a game.

#### Phase 3 Creating

And finally, I combined the knowledges that I already have on music and the new things together to complete my goal and create a digital game for visually impaired players. I love the all of them. Every process to me is a good thing. And lead me to the success.

## Game Mechanic

Players are expected to complete the level without seeing the game screen. Players need to use left arrow and right arrow on the keyboard to control the character which is running straight forward on a 3 column track. There will be coins and capsules to collect as well as obstacles to dodge. With the help of headphones, you can hear the sound coming from different directions. It's a hint. When you hear it from left, you need to press left arrow to dodge the obstacles. And when it's from right, you need to press right arrow. As you running along the track, dodging and collecting. You will see a finishline in the front. Pass it then you will be lead to a result page. You can check your time and the items that you collect and enjoy the ending music.
