## What does it do with IMS440?

This project is the cooperation between the MeshMyCampus company and the IMS440 Senior Capstone course at Miami University. The course was lead by the professor Ashely Sieb and the MeshMyCampus project team. The students were separated into teams with different goals based on their own skills. I, as a user experience designer focused student, worked in the product design and user experience team with Josh Bracy, Riley Riotto, and Meng Li.

## What's my role?

During the semester, I individually designed the onboarding part of the application and made them adapt to different platforms such as laptops, Tablets, and Mobile devices. And I designed the logos and elements in the onboarding page.
